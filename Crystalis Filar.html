		<h1>Crystalis Filar</h1>
		<p>
			Crystalis Filar, the Crystal of Threads. An ancient stone written in legends to have come from The Creator. Such power can only be harnessed to do what is in the holder's soul. An evil person can only do evil deeds.<br><br>
			Hundreds of years ago, an ancient civilization met an unbelivable, but yet awestriking demise. It seemed that physics as they knew it was being torn apart. Eventually, in a green explosion that could be seen from a distant galaxy, that planet erupted.<br><br>
			Legends arose, and some came close to predicting what happened. Was this from either sheer luck, or some divine calling?<br><br>

		<h2>Areas</h2>
		<h3>Valley of The Antispirit</h3>
		<p>Desolate. Buidings are shattered and destroyed. There's a demonic feel. The valley is more of a crater. Trees outline the ridge, but face away from the center. The trees are smoldering. In the center is a satanic-looking ruin with weird symbols.</p>
		<h3>Cryztalyx Minor</h3>
		<p>An underground cave city filled with both highly futuristic buildings, but also very old rustic buildings. The walls of the cave are mirrors that reflect the player. There are neon crystals all over the walls.</p>
		<h3>Cryztalyx Major</h3>
		<p>Buildings look like they disobey physics, but only show the outlines of them in bright neon colors. Entering certain buildings teleport the player to another. in the center is the "great divide." A half-transparent wall, where beyond it is nothing but purple fire. in the center of it is a tunnel that leads to a dead end.</p>
		<h3>The World's End</h3>
		<p>A combination of Valley of The Antispirit, Cryztalyx Minor, and Cryztalyx Major, but you can't interact with any of the buildings. where the ruin of Valley of The Antispirit used to be is a neon black orb.</p>
		<h3>Tundra's Keep</h3>
		<p>After Project Tundra's aftermath was taken care of, a small remnant of the world was left over, permanently infected with Tundric Energy. The area here has no buildings, and is just a stretch of snow. There are neon white fires scattered about. In the dead center is a bottomless pit.</p>
		<h3>Bottom's Pit</h3>
		<p>Solid black walls, floor, and ceiling. Nothing much going on here visually.</p>
		<h3>Intergalactic Hallway</h3>
		<p>A long hallway with neon doors that get darker as the hallway goes on. White neon to pure black. the floor is half invisible, and The World's End is below. At the end is a door with a swirl on it.</p>
		<h3>Crystaline Wastelands</h3>
		<p>This area is suspended in time. A brief moment of history, displayed forever. it shows a normal looking village, but the earth is cracked, and the villagers are in positions of panic. floating in the sky is a crystal changing colors from red, to blue, to green, etc.</p>
		<h3>Crystal Minor</h3>
		<p>Equal to Cryztalyx Minor, but everything is overgrown with growing crystals. Yet again, the rainbow crystal is floating in the air.</p>
		<h3>Crystal Major</h3>
		<p>A ruins in the sky. Huge crystals grow from the cloud. The rainbow crystal takes a completely different form now. There's a barrier of white with gold symbols surrounding the whole area.</p>
		<h3>The Godsplace</h3>
		<p>Pure white room with a huge golden throne. In front of the throne is a pedastal with a hole perfect for the Crystal.</p>
